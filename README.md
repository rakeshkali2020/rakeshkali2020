# Hi There ðŸ‘‹

<p> I really hate bios, so let's keep it short. Hi, I'm Rakesh Singh, a passionate self-taught Full Stack web developer and a graphics designer from India. My passion for creativity lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.</p>

<p> I love to fabricate an article with a great ardour and only once a week. Additionally, my expertise revolves around web development, graphics designing and creating animations and writing as well.</p>
